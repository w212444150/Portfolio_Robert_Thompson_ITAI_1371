This portfolio highlights the profound work I have dedicated most of my time to this semester. Follow my academic journey displaying assignments completed by learning and applying new terminology, functions, models, data and ML libraries. The skills I learned, forgot, re-learned and implemented include: setting up Git environments, loading and analyzing sample datasets, developing a binary classification model using logistic regression, then culminated this new knowledge and skillset with a team project to build an anamoly detection system to identify shoplifitng and suspicious behavior by utilizing feature scaling that addresses class imbalance and accurately isolates high-risk patterns. 

As a former Airborne Infantry Communications Team Sergeant with multiple deployments, I view Machine Learning as a digital force multiplier. Inspired by systems like Anduril’s Lattice OS, I am pursuing ethical hacking to build autonomous models that proactively hunt and eliminate bad actors in cyberspace by applying tactical discipline and a passion for AI to the cyber battlefield rather than just reacting to them to ensure we outmaneuver the adversary. My goal is to use AI to automate threat detection and elimination across air, IoT, digital, and physical domains to protect our country, citizens, businesses, and infrastructure.

# I searched for ways to make the project stand out and decided to do this and keep it simple. This code was partially generated using AI because I could not get the badges and colors to print without an error each time and ~14 tries later I deleted everything, got it back and I summoned 🧞‍♂️Gemini 🧞‍♂️.
