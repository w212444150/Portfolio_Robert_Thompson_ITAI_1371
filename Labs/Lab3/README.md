# Lab 3: Heart Disease Prediction- A binary classification model using Logistic Regression to predict heart disease risk based on patient vitals (Cleveland Dataset)

## What I Learned
* **Logistic Regression:** How to apply this algorithm to problems where the outcome is binary (Yes/No).
* **Medical Data Interpretation:** Learned to work with specific medical features like "Cholesterol" and "Resting Blood Pressure" to understand feature importance.
* **Evaluation Metrics:** Focused on the Confusion Matrix to see how many "False Negatives" (missed diagnoses) occurred, which is critical in healthcare.

## Challenges Faced
* **Data:** Some names for medical terminology (like 'cp' for chest pain or 'trestbps') were not familiar.
* **Resolution:** I researched the dataset documentation to rename columns or understand what physical symptom each feature represented.
* We were shown in class what to do and did part of assignment in class.
